## Backgammon

### **Description**

This is my first project as a student with Get Coding. In this project I tried to simulate two sections of Wechsler's IQ test for adults using JavaScript/Html/CSS.

In the first section, the app will show you some patterns. You need to recreate each pattern by dragging and dropping the provided shapes onto the given grid.
In the original test the user should use special cubes to create the patterns, but it was a little bit more than I could do in my first project so I went with the 2D version of it. Maybe I upgrade it in next versions ðŸ™‚.  

In the second section, you will encounter mathematical questions. You need to answer them in the allotted time.    

And finally you will receive your points for each section and a description for that on a standard scale. 

Please give it a try and I'll be happy to hear about your comments.

### **Motivation**

My wife is a psychologist, and we often discuss our work. I recall her telling me about Wechsler's IQ test and how it could be life changing if our children took it at a young age and we could use the results to guide them to the best path for them.
That is why I decided to create this web-app. However, because this is only two sections of the test and not the entire test, the results are only valid for these sections.
