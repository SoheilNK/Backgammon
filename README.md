## SoSep Backgammon Game
---

### **Description**

This project is a Backgammon game developed as part of my coursework in the Get Coding program. It has evolved from a simple two-player game in the second module to a sophisticated online multiplayer game in the third module.

### **Module 2 - Foundations**
In the second module, the game was developed using React and TypeScript. Additional libraries used included:
- dnd kit
- Tailwind
- React Three Fibre
- React Router

Special thanks to Mitchell Hynes for his mentorship during this phase.

### **Module 3 - Expansion to Online Multiplayer**
The game has been significantly expanded in the third module, integrating a robust backend to support online multiplayer functionality. The technologies used include:
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express
- Cognito
- MySQL
- JWT
- WebSocket
- TypeORM

This development phase was made successful with the invaluable support and guidance of my coach, Brandon Bemister.

### **Deployment**
The game has been successfully deployed on AWS, showcasing my capabilities in both front-end and back-end development.

### **Acknowledgments**
I am grateful for the continued support of my coaches and the Get Coding program, which have been instrumental in my journey of learning and growth in the field of programming.
